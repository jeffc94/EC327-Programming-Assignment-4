Additional Comments:
Not sure what a diff tool is. 
Able to save variables into a text file, but didn't have time to add restore functionality in my program.
Tuna mating might be a little iffy, had a problem with looking for a mate every time a tuna is hiding.
Other than that, I think everything else is working properly.
Sorry you're stuck grading this, good luck with finals and everything!
